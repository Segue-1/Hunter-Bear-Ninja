This project is a variant of rock-paper-scissors.  The user selects a character and the computer randomly selects a character.
It keeps track of win to lose ratio.  It also keeps track of whether or not the player won the previous round and what
character the NPC used in that round. If the player won, then the computer will not select the same character twice.  
This strategy is based off of a study that found that if a player wins a round of rock-paper-scissors, then they are more 
likely make the same play.  By having the computer select a different play it should have a higher probability of winning.
